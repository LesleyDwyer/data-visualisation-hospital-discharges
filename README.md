# data-visualisation-hospital-discharges

This is the coursework for my Data Visualisation module at City, University of London in 2018-19. We were asked to pose research questions, collect data and build visualisations to answer the research questions using Litvis.

To open the files using Litvis, you must install Litvis first. Instructions for this are in the installingLitvis.pdf file. You must also keep the folder structure intact, i.e. Coursework, css and narrative-schemas.

Then Navigate to the Coursework folder and open the courseworkPG.md file. From here, go to the Packages menu and click on 'Markdown Preview Enhanced with litvis' and then 'Toggle'. This should display the visualisations in the preview window. To view the data file, open the coursworkPG_Data.md file. Alternatively, you can view these in Html.

Within the Coursework folder, there are 6 files:
1) courseworkPG.md - the visualisatons in Litvis
2) courseworkPG_Data.md - the data copied into a Litvis file
3) courseworkPG.html - the visualisatons in Html
4) courseworkPG_Data.html - the data file in Html
5) Data Prep for Data Vis Coursework.ipynb - data preparation in a Jupyter Notebook
6) Data Prep for Data Vis Coursework.html - data preparation in Html
